1. Local search implimentation using simple hill climbing algorithm for weighted undirected graph partitioning
2. Two heuristics have been used here. One randomly swaps the two sets containing n nodes each of the graph of 2n nodes.
3. The other heuristic selects the heaviest weighted edge and put the nodes of the edge into the same set so that while partitioning the heaviest weight doesn't get counted.
